Laravel-inspired validation for HTML forms, built for simplicity of use: ðŸ˜‹

<img src="./misc/intro.jpg" />
Facile (French word for "easy", pronounced `faÂ·sil`) is an HTML form validator that is inspired by Laravel's validation style and is designed for simplicity of use.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i @upjs/facile-validator
```

<br/>

## Usage

HTML:

```html
<form>
  <input data-rules="bail|required|number|between:1,10" />
</form>
```

The rules for every input are separated with a pipe character (vertical line) `|`. In this example, we've assigned four rules for that `input`:

- bail
- required
- number
- between

<br/>

JavaScript:

```javascript
import { Validator, enLang as en } from '@upjs/facile-validator';

const form = document.querySelector('form');
const validator = new Validator(form, {
  lang: en,
});

form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  validator.validate();
});
```

Now every input with `data-rules` attribute in the `form` will be validated.

---

### accepted

The input (checkbox, radio) must be checked:

```html
<input data-rules="accepted" />
```

---

### alpha

The input value must contain only alphabetic characters.

```html
<input data-rules="alpha" />
```

The input value must contain only alpha-numeric characters, dashes, and underscores.

```html
<input data-rules="alpha-num-dash" />
```

---

### bail

If a set of rules contains `bail` rule, the validation for the input will be stopped as soon as a rule fails, and then other rules will not be processed.

```html
<input data-rules="bail|required|number|between:1,10" />
```

_`required` rule will be processed and if it fails, other rules will not be processed._

---

### between

The input value must be a number between the given range.

```html
<input data-rules="between:1,10" />
```

_The numbers lower than 1 and higher than 10 are not accepted._

---

### digits

The input value must be a number with the given length.

```html
<input data-rules="digits:10" />
```

_Only a number with the length of 10 is accepted (e.g. 1234567890)_

---

### email

The input value must be an email.

```html
<input data-rules="email" />
```

### int

```html
<input data-rules="int" />

### max

This rule is used for multiple purposes.

With the combination with the `number` rule, the input value must be a number less than or equal to the given number:

```html
<input data-rules="number|max:50" />
```

_Only a number less than or equal to 50 will be accepted._

If `max` is used without `number` rule, the input value is considered as a `string` and then the input value must be a string with a maximum length of the given number:

```html
<input data-rules="max:5" />
```

_Only strings with the length of 5 or less will be accepted._

---

### min

This rule is used for multiple purposes.

With the combination with the `number` rule, the input value must be a number greater than or equal to the given number:

```html
<input data-rules="number|min:50" />
```

_Only a number greater than or equal to 50 will be accepted._

If `min` rule is used without `number` rule, the input value is considered as a string and then the input value must be a string with a minimum length of the given number.

```html
<input data-rules="max:5" />
```

_Only strings with the length of 5 or higher will be accepted._

---

```

If used without `number` rule, the input value is considered as a string and then the input value must be a string with the exact length of the given number:

```html
<input data-rules="size:5" />
```

_Only the strings with the length of 5 are accepted._

---

### starts-with
